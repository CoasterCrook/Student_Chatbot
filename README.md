# Welcome to the Student Chatbot!

TEbot was developed by a team of junior developers as the final project of our 14 week software development bootcamp in December of 2022. Our application will prompt the user for then name and then provide help on a variety of topics related to the bootcamp. The user can ask TEbot for help related to the curriculum, the pathway program, motivational quotes, and even job postings!
